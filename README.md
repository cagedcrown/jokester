JOKESTER
Think you got what it takes to make people laugh? Test your skills on Jokester

You're going to build an application that allows users to post jokes, have them upvoted and favorited by other users.
Users can also follow other users to see all their new jokes.
THE DEETS

PSEUDOCODE

Build your ERDs
Think about the relationships and foreign keys in play
How will you name your models?
How will you associate the different models using?
What will be the different attributes of your models?
TDD

Test your models, their associations and their validations
Migrations && Models

Make your tests pass
User authentication

Implement user auth and allow users to securely sign up and sign in to your website.
You have the option to use the method we've learned with Sinatra and readapt it to Rails.
Or check out Devise, a gem that takes care of authentication in the back end: https://github.com/plataformatec/devise
Users will have to be logged in in order to see any page on the website
The landing page will be the index of all the jokes
CRUD FUNCTIONALITIES

A user will be able to create, read, update and delete jokes.
A user will be able to comment on the jokes. Think about how you will organize your routes (resources) in order to connect the comments to the joke.
A user will be able to create, read, update and delete jokes.
A user will be able to vote a joke up or down. A user can only vote ONCE
Will the vote be its own entity or part of the joke?
FOLLOWING RELATIONSHIPS

Look up self-referential associations and this railscast: http://railscasts.com/episodes/163-self-referential-association
Users can favorite jokes (except their own)
Users can follow other users (only once)
STYLING

Add some styles!
DEPLOY

BONUS

Implement User auth with Twitter
Implement another API you think would benefit this app
